# contact-angle-python
Code for computing contact angles from 3D tomograms using using the c

The code can be used to compute contact angles from multiphase images where the interface between two phases is in contact with a solid. It uses python command line integrated in Avizo to extract 2D slices from 3D images and compute the contact angles. The input images are supposed to be 3D segmented images, where 3 phases (two fluids and one solid) are present.

This code can be pasted in the phython interface of Thermofisher Avizo 9.5 visualization software.
